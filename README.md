# Average RTT

Measure the average round-trip time (RTT) between the client and the server.

## Quick Start

```console
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm serve
```

This script starts up http-server at http://localhost:6969/ to serve `index.html` and the web socket server ([server.mts](./server.mts)). See [serve.js](./serve.js) for more details.

## Dev

```console
$ pnpm dev
$ pnpm serve
```
